The machine is the great Unknown of philosophy. Given that you meet her incessantly, at least in metaphorical form, this might seem an awkward statement. Nevertheless – it gets visible, when one inspects our image of God: Subsequently he has been re-educated to a stage designer, a clockmaker and last but not least: a programmer. But what is the philosophical nerv of the machine? Starting with the enigmatic figure of the ›deus ex machina‹, the reader is confronted – in short and succinct paragraphs, with a thinking without thinker. Beyond the historical excursions, Martin Burckhardt demonstrates the slow, but inevitable retreat of philosophy, accompanied by the synchronous explosion of machine intelligence. The machine is not a technical gadget, but  a spiritual being: the unconcious of philosophy, of society in general. Could the ghost in the machine be released, one might dream of a philosophy radically renewed, with great presence of mind and free of any metaphysical ballast.
