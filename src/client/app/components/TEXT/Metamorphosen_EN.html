The initial point was the amazement why our histories of philosophy would link the Age of Mechanization to the 17</span><span class="T5">th</span><span class="T7"> century, where the material machine is a product of the 12</span><span class="T5">th</span><span class="T7"> or 13</span><span class="T5">th </span><span class="T7">century </span><span class="T6">. </span><span class="T7">In contrast to Kant who transplanted time and space into the  realm of pure reason, the leading idea was that time and space are no arbitrary constructs of Pure Reason, but modes of perception, deeply interwoven with daily practices.
