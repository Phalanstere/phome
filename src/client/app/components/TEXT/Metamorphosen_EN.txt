The book, which took some five years to write, undertakes a journey  through cultural history, from the erection of the Gothic cathedral to our digital presence. The initial point was the amazement why our histories of philosophy would link the Age of Mechanization to the 17th century, where the material machine is a product of the 12th or 13th century . In contrast to Kant who transplanted time and space into the  realm of pure reason, the leading idea was that time and space are no arbitrary constructs of Pure Reason, but modes of perception, deeply interwoven with daily practices. Hence, the bool tells about the construction of the Gothic cathedral, the birth of the wheelwork machine, the signicance of interest, central perspective, the tamed nature in the French park architeture, the significance of Photography, the telegraphic space, finally the birth of our computer culture.
