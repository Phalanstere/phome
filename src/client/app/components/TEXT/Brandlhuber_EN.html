This invitation haunted me for a while, just because of its artibirariness – until I came up with the solution to take his identity. Which would allow me to credit a slightly unkwnown person with anything imaginable, but knowing, on the other hand, that this would not happen in the evacuated space of fiction. To my astonishment Brandlhuber was content with such an arrangement. An awkward game began that unfolded some inner dynamics and led me – once the exbition went public - to appear as Brandhuber, recapitualte this comedy of mistaken identity and to give my Brandhuber-identity back tu Burckhardt who was, in the shape of real Brandlhuber, also present. </span></p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P3"> </p><p class="P3"> </p></body></html>
