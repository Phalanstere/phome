As with its predecessor, this book took five years to write. The starting point was the unanswered question, what a machine actually is – a problem that had already haunted the „Metamorphoses of Time and Space“. This bewilderment became the book's leitmotiv: the fact that the Greek culture talk about a machine, although there is no material artifact in sight. The obscurity that surrounds the machine is the more amazing, as it coincides with radical changes and evokes fervent questions of a religios nature. Beginning with the question of money, the chapters of the book treat the alphabet, the Dogma of the Immaculate Conception, the birth of the national state, the Guillotione, electro-magnetic script, Ada Lovelace, Freuds psychic apparatus and the suice of the computer pioneer Alan Turing. The book got a recommendation for the best-list of NDR and Süddeutscher Zeitung. 

„Burckhardts Groß-Essay animiert – anders als Sloterdijks Wortblasen – zum Weiterdenken.“ (Der Spiegel)

„Burckhardt ist ein glänzendes und brilliant geschriebenes Buch über die Magie der Maschinen gelungen“ (Falter)
